Investors, ranging from small to large-scale, can purchase these units, complete with clear property titles. Additionally, Ironman guarantees a net rental agreement for a base term of two years, which is extendable up to six. We offer an enticing 5.5% annual return calculated on the invested amount, not tied to the number of acquired units.'
